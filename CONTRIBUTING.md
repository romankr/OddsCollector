## Code of Conduct

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this project! By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/romankr/OddsCollector/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the application, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help with prioritization of the issue.

### Pull Requests

PRs to this project are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
